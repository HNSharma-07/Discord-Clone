# Discord-Clone
This is a clone of Discord website that I have built to brush up my skills of Tailwind CSS with responsiveness.

I have build this clone from scratch:

1. getting started with installation part of tailwind css https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss
2. set-up for font, images, color variables in tailwind config file
3. learning tailwind while building the clone
4. making it responsive
5. building the project deployment ready
6. making this github repo
7. deploying it to netlify app via this github repository

the site is live on : https://discord-clone-tailwind-css.netlify.app/
